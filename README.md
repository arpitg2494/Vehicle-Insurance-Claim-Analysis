About Dataset:
Vehicle Insurance Fraud Detection - Link - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/vehicle-claim-fraud-detection

Vehicle insurance fraud involves conspiring to make false or exaggerated claims involving property damage or personal injuries following an accident. Some common examples include staged accidents where fraudsters deliberately “arrange” for accidents to occur; the use of phantom passengers where people who were not even at the scene of the accident claim to have suffered grievous injury, and make false personal injury claims where personal injuries are grossly exaggerated.

Suggestions based upon Conclusions reached through EDA:

Risk Management and Prevention Measures

1.	Although there is a huge market for insurance buyers in tier 3 cities and rural areas, Urban areas should be focused on to avoid/catch any insurance frauds.
2.	Insurance claim filed by External agents who are not directly associated to the company should be go through an extra layer of check and balances as 99% of the frauds are committed by external agents.
3.	Companies should look into insurance premiums for older vehicle. As almost 90% of the frauds are committed by 5 years and older vehicle. Companies should provide incentive to the users for filing premium for older vehicle on top of just reducing premium. Most users see unclaimed insurance as money wasted.
4.	More than 90% of the fraud claims did not have any witness present and any police report filed. Although its an amicable decision to not file a police report for a minor collision as more FIRs would burden the Police system, but still companies should probe more carefully when it comes to Insurance claims with no reports filed.

Customer Satisfaction and Business Strategy

1.	Companies should give monetary incentive or equivalent to users who don’t file claim for their policies.
2.	Insurance companies should drastically reduce insurance premium in later years of vehicle life as user finds non usage of insurance claim as a wasteful hence commit more fraud.
3.	Companies should give cash-back for buying insurance policies from them for consecutive years.
4.	Company should get into the market for 2nd hand cars and give the policy holder a market place to sell their vehicles.
5.	Companies should give huge monetary benefits to users who were loyal to them and didn’t claim insurance for buying their new vehicle.
